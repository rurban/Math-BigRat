For an updated list of bugs, see

  https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Dist/Display.html?Name=Math-BigRat

Known bugs:

* BigRat does not handle modify() yet or in a very incomplete manner
* There are probably many... rats.

Some things are not yet implemented, or only implemented half-way:

* inf handling (partial)
* NaN handling (partial)
* rounding (not implemented except for bceil/bfloor)
* $x ** $y where $y is not an integer
* bmod(), blog(), bmodinv() and bmodpow() (partial)

Please send me test-reports, your experiences with this and your ideas - I love
to hear about my work!
